        <h3>Power Ranger Jungle Fury</h3>
        <p>For over 10,000 years, a spirit of pure evil known as Dai Shi has been locked away and safely guarded by the Pai Zhua - The Order of the Claw - a secretive Kung Fu clan. The Pai Zhua select their three top members, Jarrod, Theo Martin, and Lily Chilman, to become the new guardians of Dai Shi. Jarrod's arrogant and bullying nature led to him being excluded. Instead, a rookie named Casey Rhodes is chosen.</p>

            <h3>The main Villain</h3>
            <p>Jarrod eventually confronted Mao in Dai Shi's cavern and challenged his master; in the ensuing struggle, he accidentally tipped over the box holding Dai Shi's spirit before fleeing after realizing what he had done. However, Dai Shi located Jarrod and possessed him for his strength, knowing that he was weak in spirit and would be helpless to resist.</p>
